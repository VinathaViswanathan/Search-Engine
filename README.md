# Search-Engine
This project is a simplified implementation of a search engine built using Java, SQL, and Web Crawler, designed to help understand how search systems work behind the scenes. It explores core concepts such as indexing, ranking, and query processing, and implements foundational algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse and analyze data structures during document crawling or graph-based link analysis. The project combines backend logic with a frontend interface, offering hands-on experience with building a functional search system.
